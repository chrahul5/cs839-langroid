The author's journey began with a fascination for programming and artificial intelligence in high school, leading to studying AI and Lisp 
language at Cornell University and Harvard. The author's interest later shifted to art, studying at Rhode Island School of Design (RISD) and Accademia di Belle 
Arti in Florence. At RISD, the author took a color class that significantly influenced their artistic development. Despite not being a natural artist in high 
school, the author found a sense of belonging among the artistic tribe at RISD. However, financial constraints led the author to drop out and move to New York, 
where they continued to teach themselves to paint. 

In New York, the author was introduced to Idelle and Julian Weber. Idelle, a painter and former teacher of the author at Harvard, became a significant 
influence. The author worked as her de facto studio assistant, stretching large canvases for her. This period also marked the author's decision to become 
wealthy to have the freedom to work on whatever they wanted. 

The author returned to programming at a company called Interleaf but was dissatisfied with conventional work. This dissatisfaction led to the creation of an 
online art gallery, which evolved into an online store and then Viaweb, a software company that developed a web app for building online stores. Despite initial 
success, competition made the work stressful. After Viaweb was bought by Yahoo, the author transitioned back to the tech industry, starting a new company, 
Aspra, and later focusing on open-source projects, leading to the creation of a new Lisp language dialect called Arc. 

The author also explored online publishing and angel investing, co-founding an angel investment firm with Jessica Livingston. The firm, Y Combinator, adopted a 
batch model of funding multiple startups twice a year. Despite challenges, the author found the work rewarding. When the author's mother's health declined, they
handed Y Combinator to Sam Altman and returned to painting. 

The author emphasizes the importance of choosing the best project to work on, as attention is a zero-sum game. The author also began writing essays, working on 
Lisp as a core language, and developing a new Lisp programming language called Bel. The author moved to England in the summer of 2016 and despite challenges, 
found the work satisfying. The text covers a range of topics including the author's writing process, living in Italy, the evolution of computer technology, 
startup culture, and online publishing. The author reflects on the transition of YC fund around 2009, the challenges of running a forum, and ends with a 
philosophical discussion on the concept of invention and discovery.
